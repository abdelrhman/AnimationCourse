# [Animate Your Android App][published url]
## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]

In this course, we will start from scratch and create a material design Android app which has lots of animations and transitions. While doing so, we will learn how to create tween animations which can change the positions, dimensions and rotations of UI elements. We will also learn how to work with the new Android Transitions Framework to make changes from one activity to another, and changes from one view hierarchy to another more fluid and continuous.
